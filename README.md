# E3 Project Management

1. Internal: the general information on the asset itself, who is responsible, what license, where is the repo(s), status, maintenance aspects, etc
2. Proposals: the content that could be reused in other proposals and in which projects it is being used or even mentioned (to avoid double funding)
3. Dev: coming back to the reusable libraries that Erik and Alenka were working on to make this work easy to use in other projects
